# Grading

I set up a [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o6SQprPrUDDwlHZ-xnCCq2a5SEda0XC0?authuser=1#scrollTo=oOQDkXxjuXh5) which runs my code.

Note that I have seperated the work for each homework problem into its own file, which can be found in the HWs folder under the corresponding weeks homework.

Also, note that this project will require a working installation of pandas and numpy to run.
